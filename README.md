#About Me

##My Hobbies

* **Drawing** is something I'm trying to get into, I started out doing traditional drawing and eventually changed to digital drawing with my recent acquisition of a tablet. It has a been challenge swithching but I think I'll be able to improve to satisfactory level in a few weeks.

* **GunPla** are plastic model kits of mecha machinery from the Japanese franchise [_Mobile Suit Gundam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam) and the many other adaptations that follow it. I like building these plastic models as it's a calm and relaxing process. I have a somewhat large collection of Gunplas which make me want to build more in order to complete a set of models or get a certain model that I find interesting.

* **Phone repairing** is something i got into not too long ago and it has been a great experience. The sense of taking a broken product and restoring it back to a functionning state gives me a rewarding sensation, more so if I'm able to sell it and get a profit.


##My Favorite Websites

* **[YouTube]**(www.youtube.com) is an online video sharing platform where anyone in the world can record and upload a video onto the website. With the time the website has been up and the amount of people posting videos, the website now has an infinite amount of videos for anyone to see, you can find any type of video that aligns with your preferences. In my case, I watch gaming and animation videos, or tutorials on different things if I need help, the website in general is a great source of entertainment and is a great pass time.

* **[Game8]**(https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact) is a website that provides guides for many different games and helps players who are stuck or need advice regarding a game they are playing. I use the website to get tips for the game [_Genshin Impact_](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/home?utm_source=fab&utm_medium=home), using the website has definetly helped me improve in the game and have a better experience playing it.  
The website contains large amounts of information and presents it in an orderly and consiced manner, it seperates its guides through different categories via sub-links and gives detailed and easy to understand explanations for their tips, I really recommend this website for anyone who are having trouble in their gameplay or just want to see ways to improve their experience.

* **[Injured Gadgets]**(www.injuredgadgets.com) is an online store to buy parts for a phone, tablets, game consoles, and other device. I really like this website as I repair smart phones and this store has parts for many different models, even those that are really old. I can always expect great quality parts from this store and it has really helped me a lot in my phone repair business.
